You'll get a typical goofy Billie text, look at the tv and realize...
She's sending it from the Grammy's.

But lately she's seemed sad, distant even.

It seems her larger-than-life world is cracking at the edges.

Reporter: Pop sensation Billie Rush was recorded tossing a smoothie on her producer, Jonny X--

But that sounds like the girl you always knew.

Reporter: When asked for comment, Billie's representatives said, 'he deserved it.'

She texted you first.

Billie: i know this is going to sound crazy but i need a favor :sweat_smile:
Billie: i saw your post looking for roommates. can i move in?

Knock!
You're nervous.
What if she's not the girl you giggled with under the bleachers anymore?

<<ChangeBgImg BG_DoorOpen>>
Billie: God, I'm so glad to see you. #expression:Happy
You shouldn't have worried. Same Billie as always.
You hug and help her drag her suitcases to her room.

Dust fills the air as you shuffle about the room setting down her luggage.

// (fx: Dirty Room)
Light load for a pop star-- she's always been low-maintenance.

// (section2)
<<ZoomPortraitToLevel 1>>
Billie: I needed this. A fresh start.
She chokes back a cough as she says it.
-> Let's make it a little more fresh and open a window!
-> Sorry, it's so dusty, we can open a window!

// (section3)

You open the window-- a breeze rushes through and the dust clears.

// (end fx: Dirty Room fx: Lens Flare)
<<StopParticles Dust>>
You: What do you think?
-> It's not as fancy as what you're used to...
-> Cute, right?
Billie: $playerName, I LOVE it. This is SO you.
Billie: Kind of strange to actually be in the apartment I've seen a million times on Facetime.
You: This is going to be amazing...
-> Like old times.
// (Billie toggle visibility)
	Billie gives you another warm hug.
	She smells incredible.
-> A wild adventure
// (Billie (happy))
	Billie laughs and claps her hands together.
	Billie: Hell yea, $playerName.

You order Chinese food and put on a Webflix comedy you talk over.
She's got a piece of lo mein on her chin as she gossips about celebrity encounters.

//(section 2, slide in Billie (default)(Zoom3))
<<ZoomPortraitToLevel 2>>
Billie: --I dropped the egg right on his shoes. On Good Morning America.
Billie: He was furious.
Billie: Okay dude, I can't flip an omelette, but at least I don't secretly date girls half my age.

Your mind wanders to another minor scandal… the reason why she’s here.
	-> Hey, are you okay? // Plus Supportive trait
		Billie: Aw, $playerName. Better now that I'm here. #expression:Happy
		//(Billie (happy))
	-> So, fuck Jonny, am I right? // Plus Sassy trait
		//(Billie (happy))
		She laughs, but it's a little sad. #expression:Happy
		Billie: He's such a dick.


//(Billie (concerned))

Billie: I signed a contract when I hit it big-- make five albums with him, then I could renegotiate. #expression:Concerned
Billie: I've done four.
Billie: At first, Jonny was in the background, directing & producing. Then we got closer.
Billie: He was inspiring. He'd have an idea, I'd build on it, like an avalanche gaining momentum.
//(Billie (default))
Billie: But he started to get more and more controlling. #expression:Concerned
//(Billie (concerned))
Billie: From demanding I change lyrics to demanding what I'd wear out in public.
-> That's messed up! // Plus Supportive
	Billie: Right? I'm singing about MY life, about MY experiences. It’s the part that’s still mine.
	Billie: But maybe that's naive.
-> Is that part of his job?
	Billie: My PR people tell me what to wear. The suits tell me where to be.
	Billie: But the music is all me. It’s the part that’s still mine.
	Billie: But maybe that's naive.


-> You're a multi-platinum star, you should get say over your songs. // Plus Supportive trait
-> That's not naive-- he sounds like an asshole. // Plus Sassy trait

//(Billie (default))

Billie: Yeah. But I'm trapped in this deal.

//(Billie (concerned))

Billie: I can't handle finishing one more album with him. #expression:Concerned
Billie: We've already written a bunch of songs, but he keeps turning them down.
-> Is there any way out?

Billie: I could try to break my contract... but it'd all be a mess.
Billie: The one thing I knew was that I had to get away. I have to find my own voice again.
Billie: Get just a little bit of normalcy... Some room to breathe.
Billie: And then maybe I’ll figure out what to do about my album.

// (Billie (default))

Billie: I know it sounds silly but getting to just, room with my best friend,
Billie: do normal things, go grocery shopping, set my own schedule for a bit...

// (Billie (happy))

Billie: It's like the ultimate luxury to me. #expression:Happy

-> That doesn't sound silly to me.
	Billie leans her head on your shoulder for a moment gratefully.
-> Better than red carpets and yacht parties?
	Billie: Trust me, that stuff is overrated.

Between shows, the TV drifts to the news.
// (Section 3)

Before you're able to change it, the smoothie toss comes on.

// (slide in Billie (concerned))
Billie: I'm just worried I don’t know how to make music without him. #expression:Concerned
-> You built your career making your own music.
-> That doesn’t sound like the Billie I know.

// (Billie: default)
Billie: This is why I knew I had to come live with you.
Billie: You've always been the best reminder of who I want to be.

In the light reflected in her eyes, you feel your heart shimmer.

Your best friend, finally back by your side.

Billie: But enough moping for one night, huh?
// (Billie: happy)
Billie: Pass me that General Gao's. Let's slam this, then how about a big night out on the town? #expression:Happy
	-> Let's goooo!
		Billie: I found the COOLEST place, wait 'till you see it...
	-> Are you worried about paparazzi?
		Billie: I didn't see anyone on the way in.
		Billie: Besides, there's no way they know about the place we're going to...
